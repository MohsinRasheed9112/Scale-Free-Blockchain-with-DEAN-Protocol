# Scale-Free Blockchain with DEAN Protocol

This project implements a Python-based simulation of a scale-free blockchain network incorporating aspects of the DEAN (A Lightweight and Resource-efficient Blockchain Protocol for Reliable Edge Computing) protocol. The focus is on dynamically adjusting network parameters for optimized performance in edge computing environments, particularly by automating the connectivity parameter 'm' and enhancing the block validation process through leader election.

## Features

- **Scale-Free Network Model**: Adaptation of the blockchain network to mimic scale-free characteristics, which are prevalent in real-world networks.
- **Dynamic 'm' Adjustment**: Real-time adjustment of the connectivity parameter 'm' based on current network conditions, aiming to optimize the network's topology for improved performance.
- **Leader Election for Block Validation**: Implementation of a leader election mechanism to streamline the block validation process, ensuring faster consensus.
- **Parallel Mining Simulation**: Facilitation of parallel block mining processes to enhance transaction throughput and reduce latency, vital for edge computing scenarios.
- **Performance Measurement**: Tools for measuring the blockchain's performance in terms of throughput and latency, providing valuable insights into its efficiency and scalability.
